User Home Directory Enumeration

User Home Directory Enumeration involves systematically listing and exploring the contents of user directories in a Linux system to gather information about files, configurations, and potentially sensitive data.

Steps for User Home Directory Enumeration:

	List Contents of the Root Directory:

		This command provides a detailed recursive listing of all files and directories in the /root directory:
			
			$ ls -ahlR /root/

	List Contents of the Home Directory:

		This command lists all user directories under /home, showing files and directories recursively with detailed information:
			
			$ ls -ahlR /home/
			
	List other users home directories

			$ ls -ahlR /root/; ls -ahlR /home/

	Examine Specific User Directories:

		For each user, navigate into their home directory and list the contents:
			
			$ ls -ahlR /home/infosec
			$ cd /home/infosec
			$ ls -alh

Common Targets During Enumeration:

	Configuration Files

			.bashrc, .bash_profile, .profile       –    Shell configurations.

			.ssh/                                  –    SSH keys and configuration files.

			.gitconfig                             –    Git configuration.
			
			.vimrc, .tmux.conf, .screenrc          –   Configurations for Vim, Tmux, and Screen.
			
			.gitconfig, .git-credentials           –     Git settings and potentially stored credentials.
			
			$ cat ~/.bashrc
			
			$ cat ~/.bash_profile
			
			$ cat ~/.zshrc
			
	User bash history

			$ cat ~/.bash_history; cat ~/.nano_history; cat ~/.atftp_history; cat ~/.mysql_history; cat ~/.php_history

	User mails

			$ cat ~/.bashrc; cat ~/.profile; cat /var/mail/root; cat /var/spool/mail/root

	Command History:

			.bash_history          –        History of executed bash commands.

			.mysql_history         –        History of executed MySQL commands.

	Sensitive Data Files:

			.ssh/id_rsa             –           Private SSH keys.

			id _rsa_bee             –           Custom or renamed SSH keys.

	Application Data:

			.mozilla/firefox/                                 	–      Firefox user profiles and data.

			.config/google-chrome/                  						–      Google Chrome user data.

			.config/filezilla/                                  –      FileZilla configuration and saved sites.

			.putty/  or  .putty/sessions/            						–      PuTTY session configurations.

			.thunderbird/ or .mozilla-thunderbird/              –      Thunderbird email client data.
